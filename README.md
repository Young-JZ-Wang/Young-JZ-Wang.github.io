# Welcome to My Personal Website!

This is the source code for Jon Barron's public academic website: [https://jonbarron.info/](https://jonbarron.info/). Clone it, tweak it, and make it your own!

Of course, I didn’t create all this magic by myself. I’ve been inspired by some awesome websites along the way. A big shoutout to:

- [Esther Lin 林詠惠](https://estherlin.github.io/) – Her website is a true work of art, and I drew a lot of inspiration from it!
- [Keunhong Park](https://keunhong.com/) – The design and functionality here are top-tier, definitely a source of inspiration.
- [Joseph Lee](https://josephlee31.github.io/) – Another incredible website that sparked some ideas for my own project.

Funny story: When I was first setting up the site, I accidentally set the loading screen to show a picture of Yoda with the text "Do or do not, there is no try." I thought it was motivational at first... until it appeared every time I refreshed the page. I’m pretty sure I spent more time looking at wise Yoda than actually working. Eventually, I realized the wisdom was in "doing" the coding, not just watching Yoda do it for me!

Just... maybe skip the Jedi philosophy in your loading screens unless you're feeling extra wise. Enjoy!

Thanks, ChatGPT, for debugging my way through it!
