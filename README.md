# Welcome to My Personal Website!

This is the source code for Jon Barron's public academic website: [https://jonbarron.info/](https://jonbarron.info/). Feel free to clone it, tweak it, and make it your own!

Of course, I didn’t create all this magic by myself. I’ve been inspired by some awesome websites along the way. A big shoutout to:

- [Esther Lin 林詠惠](https://estherlin.github.io/) – Her website is a true work of art, and I drew a lot of inspiration from it!
- [Keunhong Park](https://keunhong.com/) – The design and functionality here are top-tier, definitely a source of inspiration.
- [Joseph Lee](https://josephlee31.github.io/) – Another incredible website that sparked some ideas for my own project.

Feel free to clone, customize, and make this your own masterpiece. Enjoy!
